Good players convincing each other that they are good is natural and believable (because they are good), but has the secondary effect that you seem good and the third player that the players are not currently talking about seems evil. By convincing themselves that they are good, they convince themselves that a good player is evil."}],[{text:"Let the good players convince themselves which player of the three is evil.

Giving information that is unlikely to occur even for a drunk player can really throw the good team into confusion. Be aware though... at least one of the three players that you claim is evil will be executed. Maybe two. Maybe all three."}],[{text:"If you are the Demon, bluffing as the Noble and giving correct information is fairly easy to do, and makes you look good. It is a safe, effective bluff. Unlike claiming to be the Investigator and claiming to have seen a Baron but then the Outsider count doesn't match your words, or claiming to be the Undertaker that has seen a Pit-Hag be executed but nobody has changed character, simply pointing out which players are evil is a lot easier to do since it is hard to disprove. Even if there is some character in play that makes you uncertain which players are Minions, such as a Poppy Grower or Magician or if you're a freshly converted Fang Gu or Snake Charmer, you are fairly likely to choose a Minion just by random chance when picking three players.

Remember exactly what was said, to avoid confusion. For example, if the Storyteller says "All minions are on the blue couch", and you tell the group that "all players on the blue couch are minions", you have made a logical error. Or, if the Storyteller says "The Demon is wearing glasses", and you tell the group "The Demon is someone who wears glasses.", be aware that these statements are slightly different - if the Demon takes their glasses off without you noticing, and you keep telling the group that the Demon is wearing glasses, you will be in error.'}],[{text:"Visit the Storyteller every day, to receive as much information as you can.

This does not mean that a night without death is any guarantee that your ability was the cause though. In Bad Moon Rising, there are as many reasons people don't die as there are reasons they do (e.g. Exorcist, Innkeeper, Po charging up)! To be sure your ability is the cause and the recent executee should be condemned, do some sleuthing - since you affect all abilities in the game, you should be able to find evidence that other abilities did not work as expected. As an example, characters like the Chambermaid or Gambler could get odd results. Additionally, nobody will be safe from execution (e.g. Pacifist, Devil's Advocate), and characters like the Tinker will not randomly die that day."}],[{text:"Gun for executions! The more executions, the better chance you have of getting a minion. Good players may be reluctant to execute anyone who isn't a demon suspect as the death count can be unexpected and heavy in Bad Moon Rising, but it is worth it to remove powerful Minions like the Assassin or Mastermind from play before they can do too much damage. Combined with the one night reprieve your ability grants on successful execution, your ability should be plenty of incentive to be more aggressive than usual!"}],[{text:"Demons may be less likely to target you since they underestimate your power! Unless Minions are getting executed left and right, the Minstrel is likely to survive a little longer than other townsfolk without protections, simply because a Demon is going to be much more worried about an Exorcist or a Tea Lady surviving for another night.

If both your neighbours are good, they cannot die. The quickest and easiest way to test this is to execute - if they don't die, there's a good chance that it was your ability that saved them. Avoid characters who have immunity to execution normally (e.g. Sailor, Fool) as they will muddy the waters. You should also be cautious of the Devil's Advocate, who could mistakenly trick you into believing that an evil neighbour is actually good by timing their ability with your execution. Finally, be aware of the Pacifist - while they're alive, the storyteller may choose to spare any good executees, which is indistinguishable from your ability activating."}],[{text:"You can also choose not to be proactive at all - instead, reveal nothing and wait to see how it plays out! This gives you the security of the demon not knowing who you are for certain, which can grant advantages to you based on the composition of your neighbours.

For any other scenario, you must have at least one evil neighbour, which you will know for sure if any of your neighbours die, and can then choose to reveal once you have a suspect in mind.

Another way is to pick subtle, plausible characters for your madness - for example, having someone reveal as an Outsider in a suspected Fang Gu game, or someone who has given inconsistent information reveal as a character like the Snake Charmer."}],[{text:"An advanced way to use madness is to build a consistent narrative. For example, you can force a player to reveal as the Sage.... but it'll lend a little credence to their forced bluff if you had them bluffing as a Dreamer the day before, just like a real Sage would. This allows you to undermine the real Sage without it necessarily coming off as just one of them being mad - the simple logical thread you have created will be something the other players find pleasing and want to hold onto. Another option for a consistent narrative is to feed into the story the evil team is trying to make - for example, if you're trying to convince them a Fang Gu is in play, make people mad they are Outsiders."}],[{text:"If the good team suspects that the Vortox is in play, they will be very reluctant to end the day without an execution. If they don't have any strong leads on potential evil, they may fall back to 'safe' executions - players who have used their abilities (such as the Clockmaker or Artist). Causing a more powerful character to become mad they are one of these characters can see the good team executing them without you having to lift a finger - and if they protest, they might break madness and be executed anyway!"}],[{text:"Your ability can also affect dead players! Even if they are dead, they can still be executed should they break madness (meaning the good team does not get to execute someone of their choice instead, and the evil team gets a free night to act).

If you are mad, or if you are dealing with a mad player, knowing how madness actually works is crucial.

Tell the group which character you are, if that character receives information, make up some information to tell the group. If another player claims to be the same character, tell the group that they are lying, because YOU are that character. Do whatever you need to do to convince the group that you are the character that the Cerenovus has made you mad about being. An important thing to note, is that simply saying "I am the Dreamer", at the beginning of the day for example, then staying quiet, will probably result in your execution. It doesn't really matter "what" you say to the group, but your tone, enthusiasm, and the strength of your arguments.

Sometimes, your information is worth more than your life. Similarly, if you are not very competent at being mad about a specific character, the Storyteller may execute you - this is not the end of the world. Play on, you'll have more days to find and execute the Demon."}],[{text:"Beware the Storyteller!

If you are mad that you are a different character, but you decide to secretly tell a player or two in private what your real character is (when you think that the Storyteller isn't looking), you might accidentally be talking to an evil player that snitches on you.

The good team may want to execute you immediately, particularly in a large game, but if it takes them a few days to do so, it should still be worth it.'}],[{text:"Wait on revealing yourself until the perfect opportunity. Depending on the script, there may be some extremely dangerous Townsfolk in play. Sacrificing a day or three of activity might be worth it, to make a surprise attack on a particularly powerful character, such as the Lycanthrope, King, or the Cult Leader. Even if you only kill this one player before you die, that could be enough to save the game for the evil team."}],[{text:"Wait on revealing yourself until the very end of the game. If you can survive until the final three players, you can kill a player and win the game before the final day of nominations occur.

Towards the end of the game, it is often more useful for you to be dead (and one step closer to evil winning due to just two players alive) than alive and known to not be the Demon.

Early on in the game, it is usually best if the players are executing other players, since the chance of them executing the Demon is low. Later in the game, it is usually best if the good team is executing you, because the chance of otherwise executing the Demon is high. If you can convince the good players to execute you at the times when the Demon is suspicious, the odds favour you. If you can convince the good team to avoid executing you at the times when the Demon is trusted, then you gain the benefit of a good player executed and a good player dying due to the Psychopath each day."}],[{text:"When there are just four or five players alive, think carefully about who to attack.

If a Clockmaker or a Town Crier is in play, their information is disrupted because they will base their logic on the false assumption of which player is the Minion.

Once you have made a mistake, you must correct the mistake, to the best of your abilitees. Some mistakes will be more difficult to correct than others, and that’s okay, as long as you do your best to correct all mistakes. Some time after you have corrected the mistake, you must publicly announce that a mistake has been made and corrected.

In fact, the game is usually decided by the votes and opinions of the dead players. When you die, you lose your character ability, you may no longer nominate, and you have only one vote for the rest of the game, so use it wisely."]}],bo={title:Tc,source:_c,introduction:Ic,sections:Dc};function Sc(a,e,t){const o=a.slice();return o[2]=e[t],o}function Mc(a,e,t){const o=a.slice();return o[5]=e[t],o}function Ec(a,e,t){const o=a.slice();return o[8]=e[t],o}function Ac(a){let e;return{c(){e=T("p"),e.textContent=`${a[8]}`},m(t,o){p(t,e,o)},p:ae,d(t){t&&g(e)}}}function Oc(a){let e;return{c(){e=T("p"),e.textContent=`${a[5]}`},m(t,o){p(t,e,o)},p:ae,d(t){t&&g(e)}}}function Nc(a){let e,t,o,i=V(a[2].content),n=[];for(let r=0;r<i.length;r+=1)n[r]=Oc(Mc(a,i,r));return{c(){e=T("h3"),e.textContent=`${a[2].heading}`,t=M();for(let r=0;r<n.length;r+=1)n[r].c();o=ue(),w(e,"class","svelte-x9bdtr")},m(r,l){p(r,e,l),p(r,t,l);for(let s=0;s<n.length;s+=1)n[s]&&n[s].m(r,l);p(r,o,l)},p:ae,d(r){r&&(g(e),g(t),g(o)),fe(n,r)}}}function Rc(a){let e,t,o,i,n,r,l,s,h,u,d,c=V(bo.introduction),y=[];for(let v=0;v<c.length;v+=1)y[v]=Ac(Ec(a,c,v));let m=V(bo.sections),b=[];for(let v=0;v<m.length;v+=1)b[v]=Nc(Sc(a,m,v));return{c(){e=T("div"),t=T("details"),t.innerHTML=`<summary class="svelte-x9bdtr"><h3 class="svelte-x9bdtr">Pitch</h3></summary> <div class="pitch-list"><p>&quot;We are playing a game called Blood on the Clocktower!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Clocktower is a spooky themed party game.

If blue, you&#39;re in the good team. If red, you&#39;re in the evil team. Good wins by executing the Demon by vote. Evil wins when only two are alive left.</p> <p>The game cycles between nights and days. During the day, you talk. Good team tries to know who is whom.</p> <p>Evil players usually pick a good role to pretend to be, sowing chaos.</p> <p>During the night, everybody closes their eyes. I will wake some players with two taps when it is time for them to perform their ability or get information. This is done in silence.</p> <p style="font-style: italic">Nod means yes/no. Thumbs mean good/evil. Fingers mean numbers.</p> <p>Most of you will die. Do not worry—death doesn&#39;t remove you from the game; you still sleep at night, share information, and do your best to win. This is a team game where death could help your team.</p> <p>Finally, you can be drunk or poisoned in this game. If so, you have no ability, but I will pretend that you do.</p> <p>This happens if The Poisoner chooses you, or if you are *the* Drunk, who draws a token that they think they are.</p> <p>This is a lot of information to take in at once, so to keep things simple, there are only four things you need to remember:</p> <p>1: You may say whatever you want at any time. This is a talking game. You can talk publicly with the group or have private conversations, it is your choice.</p> <p>2: No peeking. Please keep your draw hidden. Do not look into my Grimoire of characters. Do not peek at night. If you see something you&#39;re not supposed to, it will spoil the fun.</p> <p>3: Ask me any questions you need to. If you&#39;re confused about your role, the rules, or other roles—just ask me privately. I&#39;m here to help you have fun.</p> <p>4: Play nice. This is a lying game. Kill with kindness, defend with dignity. My goal is for everyone to feel included, but that takes everyones help.</p> <p>The game will soon begin. Please be seated to draw your role.</p> <p>The first night will soon begin. Please close your eyes. The Demon will learn three roles not-in-play. As well as evil team will now see each other.</p> <hr style="width:50%"/> <p>To nominate, say “I nominate Bob.” Both players will explain themselves. A majority vote is required to execute. I will count votes clockwise by raised hands; once I have passed you, raising your hand will not count.</p> <p>A day can have many nominations. You can vote in all of them. The most voted gets executed. On a tie, no one dies.</p> <p>As dead, you lose your ability. You yourself cannot nominate others. And you just have one last vote to use.</p> <p>The dead are a major part of the game. Do not be saddened if you die! Very often, dead votes and opinions decide the game.</p> <p>With that, nominations are open!</p> <hr style="width:50%"/> <p>This is a talking game and won by talking and sharing</p> <p>This is not a survival game — the goal is to win.</p> <p>(If tantrum)&quot;I sense you&#39;re not having fun anymore. Quick break, drink some water? Let&#39;s take 5, everyone.&quot;</p> <p>(If someone needs to leave, run the Fiddler, or Umpire, or Bench)</p> <p>(If giving advice) 1. Reconfirm role, info, 2.
